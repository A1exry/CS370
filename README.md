# Pirate Intelligent Agent – Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview
This project showcases the use of reinforcement learning and neural networks to train an intelligent pirate agent. The agent was designed to navigate a simulated environment and find treasure more efficiently than a human player. The project was completed using Python and OpenAI Gym, applying deep Q-learning techniques to achieve high performance.

## Work Completed
I was given starter code that included the environment setup and a basic framework for the agent. From there, I created the Deep Q-Network from scratch, including the neural network model, training loop, experience replay mechanism, action-selection policy (epsilon-greedy), and performance tracking. I tuned hyperparameters like the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration decay to improve the agent’s performance. After sufficient training, the agent reached a 98% win rate, demonstrating successful learning.

## Reflection

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing and implementing efficient algorithms and systems. Their work powers everything from mobile apps to critical systems in healthcare and finance. In this project, I saw how computer science enables machines to learn from experience and improve performance, which is a key component in many modern applications.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by breaking them into smaller tasks, exploring existing solutions, and experimenting with code until I find what works best. In this project, I iteratively built, tested, and refined the learning algorithm while monitoring the agent’s performance. Data-driven decision-making and debugging were essential throughout the process.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethical responsibilities include building systems that are safe, fair, transparent, and respectful of user data. As an AI developer, I must ensure that the models I build do not reinforce bias, produce harmful outcomes, or behave unpredictably. I also need to consider how the system will impact both the organization and its users.
